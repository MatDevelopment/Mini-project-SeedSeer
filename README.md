# Mini-project-SeedSeer

My mini-project about a farmer trying to protect his tomato crops. A small and cozy RTS tower-defense game.

GAME CONCEPT: The idea of the mini-project was built around the basic design concepts of a tower-defense game. The main goal of the game is to protect your tomato farm from an ant colony that wants to eat up your whole farm. To prevent this the player must utilize the world terrain, which has separated sections and small passageways in which enemy units pass through. The player can then, by both keyboard and mouse input, pick up seeds which are randomly spawned across the map, and plant said seeds to either yield a grass wall (blocks enemies) or a trunk turret (damages enemies at range) at strategically chosen locations to maximize their defense capability against the ant colony. Beware that these objects sprung from the seeds do not stay permanently but will wither and die just like anything else in nature at some point. The genre of the game is an RTS, Tower-defense game.

CONTROLS: The player "godhand" (shining beam of light) is controlled via the mouse.

Seeds can be picked up by pressing LEFT CLICK when just above the seed.

Picked up seeds can be rotated by using the A and D key.

Seeds are activated by hovering over them with the shining light and pressing RIGHT CLICK. Next time the activated seed touches the world terrain, it springs up and turns into either a grass wall or a trunk turret, depending on the activated seed.
